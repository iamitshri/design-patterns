== Object Oriented Design Tips

- SOLID
* Single responsibility principle
** Classes should aim for high cohesiveness
** Cohesion is a measure of how closely a class or a module supports a single purpose or responsibility.
* Open Closed Principle
** Classes should be closed for modification but open for extension
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle
    - Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
    - High-level components should not depend on our low-level components, rather, they should both depend on abstractions.
- YAGNI
* You ain't going to need it.
* You don't need it now.
** Don't add new functionality until its necessary.
- KISS
* Keep it simple stud
- DRY
* Don't repeat yourself
- OverEngineering
* Avoid adding those extra features, safety, bells and whistles your customers don't care about
- Encapsulate what varies
* Parts of code that changes together, stays together
* Separate out parts of code that vary or change from those that remain the same.
- Favor Composition over inheritance
- Code to an interface and not against a concrete implementation
- Encapsulate behaviors
- Don't call us we will call you
- Components are loosely coupled and talk to each other over a well-defined API
- Fine line between complexity and understandability vs Flexible & Extensible

== Creational

=== Static Factory
- Decouple client code from the concrete classes
- Advantages
* Unlike constructors, they have names.
Readability improvement
* Unlike constructors, they are not required to create new objects.
Useful in controlling object creation e.g. singleton, flyweight
* Unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type
* Class of the returned object can vary from call to cal as a function of input param
- Disadvantages:
* Classes only providing factories and w/o public or protected constructors, can not be subclassed
* hard to notice
- e.g. java.util.Calendar.getInstance()

=== Builder
- Used to build complex objects
- Build objects with a mix of required and non-required parameters
- e.g. StringBuilder (loosely compared). any object creation where we create object step by step, DocumentBuilder

=== Prototype
- Use the Prototype Pattern when creating an instance of a given class is either expensive or complicated.
- Create new objects by copying existing objects. The object whose copies are made is called the prototype
- Creating new objects is more expensive than copying existing objects
- Think about shallow vs deep copy
- e.g. clone method exposed by Object class

=== Singleton
- Only one object is created in JVM
- Think about cost of creation and use lazy or eager initialization
- Think about single threaded vs multi threaded environment
- e.g. java.lang.Runtime, java.awt.Desktop


=== Abstract Factory
- This Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- factory of factories


== Structural

=== Adapter
- Allow interoperability

=== Bridge
- Allows varying abstractions as well as implementations
- Decouples an implementation so that it is not bound permanently to an interface
- Abstraction and implementation can be extended independently
- Changes to the concrete abstraction classes don't affect the client

=== Composite
- Represents hierarchical tree like relation
- Composite and leaf
- The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects, or “composites” in the same way.

=== Decorator
- A wrapper on the class to enhance or extend the behavior of an object dynamically

=== Facade
- Decouple client from complex subsystem of components
- Simplifies interface
- Facade deals with interfaces, not implementation.
- Hide internal complexity behind a single interface that appears simple on the outside

=== Flyweight
- The term comes from boxing and stands for a fighter who weighs less than 111 lbs.
- Sharing state among many fine-grained objects for efficiency.
- Centralizes state for many “virtual” objects into a single location.
- Memory saving and Object explosion is avoided by sharing intrinsic state and extrinsic state is calculated
- Reduces the number of object instances at runtime, saving memory.


=== Proxy
- Proxies control and manage access to real object (think of Paralegal and Lawyer)
- The Decorator Pattern adds behavior to an object, while Proxy controls access.
- Remote Proxy
    * Local representative for an object that lives in a different jvm
- Virtual Proxy:
    * Representative for an object that may be expensive to create
    * Defers the creation of expensive object until its needed
    * Acts as a surrogate for the object before and while it is being created
- e.g. java.rmi.* package

== Behavioral

=== Memento
- Use the Memento Pattern when you need to be able to return an object to one of its previous states.
- e.g. java.io.Serializable

=== State
- The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Encapsulate state based behavior and delegate behavior to the current state
- The object will appear to change its class
- With the State Pattern, we have a set of behaviors encapsulated in state objects; at any time the context is delegating to one of those states.
- Exhibit different behaviors in different states

=== Strategy
- Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors and use delegation to decide which behavior to use
- e.g. custom comparator can be passed to this Collections.sort(list,comparator)

=== Template
- Subclasses decide how to implement steps in the algorithm
- Allows subclasses to define parts of an algorithm without modifying the overall structure or steps of the algorithm

=== Visitor
- Allows you to add operations to a composite/object hierarchy structure without changing the structure itself.
- Adding new operations is relatively easy.
- The code for operations performed by the Visitor is centralized.

=== Mediator
- Use the Mediator Pattern to centralize complex communications and control between related objects.
- Components do not need to know about each other
- They only talk to a mediator
- Simplifies maintenance of the system by centralizing control logic.

=== Observer
- A one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state all the dependents are notified
- Publish-subscribe model where subscribers get notified when publisher notifies

=== Iterator
- Allows traversal through a aggregate or a collection without exposing its internal details.
- The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an iterator

=== Command
- The Command Pattern allows us to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actually performs the action.
- Encapsulates a request as an object
- A command object encapsulates a request to do something (like turn on a light) on a specific object (say, the living room light object)


=== Chain of Responsibility
- Use when you want to give more than one object a chance to handle a request.
- Decouples the sender of the request and its receivers.
- Each receiver contains reference to next receiver.
- Each handler in turn examines a request and either handles it or passes it on to the next object in the chain
- e.g. javax.servlet.Filter.doFilter method or mouseclick events on webpage
